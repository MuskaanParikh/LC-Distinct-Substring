# LC - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without duplicate characters.

***Substring*** = A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
````

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
Constraints:
```
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
```
